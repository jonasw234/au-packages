# What is Tachidesk?
![](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/Suwayomi/Tachidesk/39490ce7/server/src/main/resources/icon/faviconlogo.png)

A free and open source manga reader server that runs extensions built for [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). 

Tachidesk is an independent Tachiyomi compatible software and is **not a Fork of** Tachiyomi.

`Tachidesk` is a general term used to describe the combination of Tachidesk-Server(this project) and one of our clients. 
Think of it roughly like the concept of "distribution" in GNU/Linux distributions, in which Linux(Tachidesk-Server) is the kernel and the difference is which desktop environment(Tachidesk client) you get with it. 

Tachidesk-Server is as multi-platform as you can get. Any platform that runs java and/or has a modern browser can run it. This includes Windows, Linux, macOS, chrome OS, etc.

Ability to sync with Tachiyomi is a planned feature.

## Is this application usable? Should I test it?
Here is a list of current features:

- Installing and executing Tachiyomi's Extensions, So you'll get the same sources
- A library to save your mangas and categories to put them into
- Searching and browsing installed sources
- Ability to download Manga for offline read
- Backup and restore support powered by Tachiyomi-compatible Backups
- Viewing latest updated chapters.

**Note:** These are capabilities of Tachidesk-Server, the actual working support is provided by each front-end app, checkout their respective readme for more info.
