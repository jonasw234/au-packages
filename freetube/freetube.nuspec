FreeTube is an open source desktop YouTube player built with privacy in mind.
Use YouTube without advertisements and prevent Google from tracking you with their cookies and JavaScript.
Available for Windows, Mac & Linux thanks to Electron.

Please note that FreeTube is currently in Beta. While it should work well for
most users, there are still bugs and missing features that need to be
addressed.

[Download FreeTube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/releases)

### Browser Extension

FreeTube is supported by the [Privacy Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect) extension, which will allow you to open YouTube links into FreeTube. You must enable the option within the advanced settings for it to work.

Download Privacy Redirect for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect/) or [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-redirect/pmcmeagblkinmogikoikkdjiligflglb).

If you have issues with the extension working with FreeTube, please create an issue in this repository instead of the extension repository.

## How does it work?
FreeTube uses a built in extractor to grab and serve data / videos.  The [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) can also optionally be used.  FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data.  While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no
longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.  Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended
to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

Go to [FreeTube's Documentation](https://docs.freetubeapp.io/) if you'd like to know more about how to operate FreeTube and its features.

*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know!
