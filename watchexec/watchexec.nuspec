        # watchexec

        Software development often involves running the same commands over and over. Boring!

        `watchexec` is a **simple**, standalone tool that watches a path and runs a command whenever it detects modifications.

        Example use cases:

        * Automatically run unit tests
        * Run linters/syntax checkers

        ## Features

        * Simple invocation and use
        * Runs on OS X, Linux and Windows
        * Monitors current directory and all subdirectories for changes
            * Uses most efficient event polling mechanism for your platform (except for [BSD](https://github.com/passcod/notify#todo))
        * Coalesces multiple filesystem events into one, for editors that use swap/backup files during saving
        * By default, uses `.gitignore` to determine which files to ignore notifications for
        * Support for watching files with a specific extension
        * Support for filtering/ignoring events based on [glob patterns](https://docs.rs/globset/*/globset/#syntax)
        * Launches child processes in a new process group
        * Sets the following environment variables in the child process:
            * If a single file changed (depending on the event type):
                * `$WATCHEXEC_CREATED_PATH`, the path of the file that was created
                * `$WATCHEXEC_REMOVED_PATH`, the path of the file that was removed
                * `$WATCHEXEC_RENAMED_PATH`, the path of the file that was renamed
                * `$WATCHEXEC_WRITTEN_PATH`, the path of the file that was modified
                * `$WATCHEXEC_META_CHANGED_PATH`, the path of the file whose metadata changed
            * If multiple files changed:
                * `$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH`, the longest common path of all of the files that triggered a change
        * Optionally clears screen between executions
        * Optionally restarts the command with every modification (good for servers)
        * Does not require a language runtime

        ## Anti-Features

        * Not tied to any particular language or ecosystem
        * Does not require a cryptic command line involving `xargs`

        ## Usage Examples

        Watch all JavaScript, CSS and HTML files in the current directory and all subdirectories for changes, running `make` when a change is detected:

            $ watchexec --exts js,css,html make

        Call `make test` when any file changes in this directory/subdirectory, except for everything below `target`:

            $ watchexec -i target make test

        Call `ls -la` when any file changes in this directory/subdirectory:

            $ watchexec -- ls -la

        Call/restart `python server.py` when any Python file in the current directory (and all subdirectories) changes:

            $ watchexec -e py -r python server.py

        Call/restart `my_server` when any file in the current directory (and all subdirectories) changes, sending `SIGKILL` to stop the child process:

            $ watchexec -r -s SIGKILL my_server

        Send a SIGHUP to the child process upon changes (Note: with using `-n | --no-shell` here, we're executing `my_server` directly, instead of wrapping it in a shell:

            $ watchexec -n -s SIGHUP my_server

        Run `make` when any file changes, using the `.gitignore` file in the current directory to filter:

            $ watchexec make

        Run `make` when any file in `lib` or `src` changes:

            $ watchexec -w lib -w src make
