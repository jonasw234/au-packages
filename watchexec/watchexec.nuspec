# watchexec

Software development often involves running the same commands over and over. Boring!

`watchexec` is a **simple**, standalone tool that watches a path and runs a command whenever it detects modifications.

Example use cases:

* Automatically run unit tests
* Run linters/syntax checkers

## Features

* Simple invocation and use
* Runs on OS X, Linux and Windows
* Monitors current directory and all subdirectories for changes
    * Uses most efficient event polling mechanism for your platform (except for [BSD](https://github.com/passcod/notify#todo))
* Coalesces multiple filesystem events into one, for editors that use swap/backup files during saving
* By default, uses `.gitignore` to determine which files to ignore notifications for
* Support for watching files with a specific extension
* Support for filtering/ignoring events based on [glob patterns](https://docs.rs/globset/*/globset/#syntax)
* Launches child processes in a new process group
* Sets the following environment variables in the child process:
    * If a single file changed (depending on the event type):
        * `$WATCHEXEC_CREATED_PATH`, the path of the file that was created
        * `$WATCHEXEC_REMOVED_PATH`, the path of the file that was removed
        * `$WATCHEXEC_RENAMED_PATH`, the path of the file that was renamed
        * `$WATCHEXEC_WRITTEN_PATH`, the path of the file that was modified
        * `$WATCHEXEC_META_CHANGED_PATH`, the path of the file whose metadata changed
    * If multiple files changed:
        * `$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH`, the longest common path of all of the files that triggered a change
* Optionally clears screen between executions
* Optionally restarts the command with every modification (good for servers)
* Does not require a language runtime

## Anti-Features

* Not tied to any particular language or ecosystem
* Does not require a cryptic command line involving `xargs`

*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know!
