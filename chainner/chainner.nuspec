A node-based image processing GUI aimed at making chaining image processing tasks easy and customizable. Born as an AI upscaling application, chaiNNer has grown into an extremely flexible and powerful programmatic image processing application.

ChaiNNer gives you a level of customization of your image processing workflow that very few others do. Not only do you have full control over your processing pipeline, you can do incredibly complex tasks just by connecting a few nodes together.

ChaiNNer is also cross-platform, meaning you can run it on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

For help, suggestions, or just to hang out, you can join the [chaiNNer Discord server](https://discord.gg/pzvAKPKyHM)

Remember: chaiNNer is still a work in progress and in alpha. While it is slowly getting more to where we want it, it is going to take quite some time to have every possible feature we want to add. If you're knowledgeable in TypeScript, React, or Python, feel free to contribute to this project and help us get closer to that goal.

*Please Note* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know.
