# About
Privaxy is a MITM HTTP(s) proxy that sits in between HTTP(s) talking applications, such as a web browser and HTTP servers, such as those serving websites.

By establishing a two-way tunnel between both ends, Privaxy is able to block network requests based on URL patterns and to inject scripts as well as styles into HTML documents.

Operating at a lower level, Privaxy is both more efficient as well as more streamlined than browser add-on-based blockers. A single instance of Privaxy on a small virtual machine, server or even, on the same computer as the traffic is originating from, can filter thousands of requests per second while requiring a very small amount of memory.

Privaxy is not limited by the browser’s APIs and can operate with any HTTP traffic, not only the traffic flowing from web browsers.

Privaxy is also way more capable than DNS-based blockers as it is able to operate directly on URLs and to inject resources into web pages.

*Please note* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please [let me know](https://github.com/jonasw234/au-packages/issues).
This is the GUI version of Privaxy. A [no GUI (console) version](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/privaxy_nogui) is also available. Both use the same configuration, so you might want to use the GUI for the initial configuration and then switch to the console version for production.
