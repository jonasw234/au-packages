    <description>
        Autopsy® is a digital forensics platform and graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit® and other digital forensics tools. It can be used by law enforcement, military, and corporate examiners to investigate what happened on a computer. You can even use it to recover photos from your camera's memory card.

    <releaseNotes>
        Specialized UIs:
        * New File Discovery UI that allows you to search and filter for certain types of files. Works best with the Central Repository storing all of the hashes you've seen.
        * New Map viewer that uses either Bing (when online) or offline map tiles.
        * Communications UI shows country names for phone numbers and fixed bug in summary panel.
        * Fixed bugs in timeline filtering.
        * Refactored backend timeline filtering code based on The Sleuth Kit data model changes to remove JavaFX dependency.

        Data Sources:
        * Added limited support for APFS disk images. Does not include encrypted volumes or ones that span multiple disks. Uses contribution to The Sleuth Kit from Black Bag Technologies.
        * New data source processor that parses “XRY File Exports”.

        Content Viewers:
        * Added a new “Context” viewer to show where a file came from. Currently shows what message a file was attached to or what URL a file was downloaded from.
        * Added support to seek and change playback speed for videos in “Application” viewer.
        * Improved support for Unicode HTML files in “Application” viewer.
        * Added support for webp image files in “Application” viewer.

        Ingest Modules:
        * Keyword Search module uses Decodetect statistical encoding detection for plain text files. Fixes issues with incorrect detection of Japanese files.
        * Embedded File Extractor module uses statistical analysis to determine encoding of file names in ZIP files. Fixes issues with ZIP files created on Windows Japanese computers.
        * Solr (Keyword Search module) now uses Japanese-specific tokenization using Kuromoji.
        * Fixed Shellbags module in RegRipper (used by Autopsy Recent Activity module) to fix parsing errors.
        * Plaso module no longer generates an error if enabled for non-disk image data sources.
        * Added support for message attachments that are stored as an external file system file. Expanded Email and Android modules to use this technique.

        General:
        * Fixed crashes by gstreamer when a video is selected.
        * Added initial capability to delete a data source from a case (excludes data in the CR).
        * Changed behavior of portable case menu item to automatically open the case and warn if it was already unpacked.
        * Fixed bug that caused issues when case metadata had Unicode values.
        * Added new Attachment APIs to the CommunicationsArtifactHelper class to support attachments stored as external file system files.

        *Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know!
