    <summary>Desktop application to efficiently search large packet captures and Zeek logs.</summary>
    <description>
*Please Note:* This package is inofficial and in no way affiliated with Brim Security.  Failing tests for this package don’t necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with their installer!

Brim is an open source desktop application for security and network specialists. Brim makes it easy to search and analyze data from:

* packet captures, like those created by Wireshark, and
* structured logs, especially from the Zeek network analysis framework.

Brim is especially useful to security and network operators that need to handle large packet captures, especially those that are cumbersome for Wireshark, tshark, or other packet analyzers.

Brim is built from open source components, including:

* zq, a structured log query engine;
* Electron and React for multi-platform UI;
* Zeek, to generate network analysis data from packet capture files.

*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know!
