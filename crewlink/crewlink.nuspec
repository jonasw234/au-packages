**CrewLink**

Free, open, Among Us proximity voice chat. 

**[DONATE TO THE PROJECT](https://paypal.me/ottomated)** (all donations will be used for server costs or paying for college) 

## About The Project

This project implements proximity voice chat in Among Us. Everyone in an Among Us lobby with this program running will be able to communicate over voice in-game, with no third-party programs required. Spatial audio ensures that you can only hear people close to you.

## Installation

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink/releases) and run the `CrewLink-Setup-X.X.X.exe` file. You may get antivirus warnings, because this program hooks into the Among Us process to read game data.

If you can, you should use a private server by deploying [this repository](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink-server).
