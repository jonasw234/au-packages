# Cupscale
Image Upscaling GUI based on ESRGAN

## Credits:
Based around [xinntao's ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) implemented via [Joey's Fork](https://github.com/JoeyBallentine/ESRGAN).

AMD/Intel GPU compatibility is possible thanks to BlueAmulet's [esrgan-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/realsr-ncnn-vulkan) based on nihui's [realsr-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan) running on Tencent's [ncnn](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) framework, as well as [xinntao's Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN).

## Supported AI Backends:
- Nvidia CUDA (Recommended)
- Vulkan (Works on any modern GPU, but is slower and takes a long time start up)
- CPU (Works without GPU, but is very slow)

## Features:
- CUDA, Vulkan/NCNN or CPU supported, with included model converter for NCNN
- On-the-fly Model Interpolation
- Model Chaining (Run images through multiple models at once)
- Batch Upscaling (Load a directory or multiple single images)
- Automatic Image tiling/merging to avoid running out of VRAM
- Pre-Processing: Optionally downscale images before upscaling
- Post-Processing: Automatically resize after upscaling
- Compatible with PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP, TGA, DDS images
- Load image straight out of the clipboard (no need to download images from web)
- Create various types of comparisons (Side-By-Side, 50/50, and before/after animations as GIF or MP4)

*To change the installation directory* use the parameter `--params "/InstallDir:C:\your\install\path"`.  Temporary files are stored in the installation directory by default, which is why you shouldn’t install the application in protected locations like Program Files.
*Please Note:* This is an automatically updated package.  If the package is outdated for more than two days, please let me know!
